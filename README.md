Shop App
========

HTML5 offline capable web app with no backend ( utilizing localStorage ) to help you track your total bill while you are shopping.

open [anasnakawa.github.io/shop-app](http://anasnakawa.github.io/shop-app) on your iOS Safari browser, and add it to home screen.

### Compatibility

since this app was built on top of [Ratchet](https://github.com/maker/ratchet), target device is only iOS (mainly iOS7+), have no idea if it should work on other paltforms ( you tell me! ).

Built using [KnockoutJs](knockoutjs.com) & [Ratchet](maker.github.io/ratchet/)
